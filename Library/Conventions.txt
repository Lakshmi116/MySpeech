This file contains all the conventions used throughout the project.

1. Input file format :  homo_1a_desc.txt, homo_1b_desc.txt

    Description:
    - Contains a sequence of integers representing the amplitudes of the waveform
    - Number of integers in this can be arbitrary, depends on the length of utterance and freqency of sampling

2. Cepstral coeffcients :  ceps_1a_desc.txt

    Description:
    - Cepstral coeffcients vector for each frame is calculated
    - This file contains cepstral vectors of all the frames of the waveform

3. Frequency of smapling :  16000 hz

4. Frame size : 320 samples  (a.k.a `N`)(~ 20ms )

5. Frame dropping : If the last frame of the waveform has less than 320 samples, it would be dropped.

6. No. of cepstral coeffcients per frame :  12 (a.k.a `P`) (dimension of the cepstal vectors is 12)

7. Distance measure: Tokhura distance is used. Calculated based on the `codebook`

8. Codebook: homo_codebook.txt

    Description:
    - Contains 32 lines
    - Each line consists of a code vector

9. Algorithm to build the code book:  -- To be filled --

10. Multilevel codebook Algorithm: -- To be filled --
